# Calculator

Web-based Calculator made while going through The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of:

- Javascript
  - DOM manipulation
  - Functions
  - Event listeners
  - Keyboard support
- CSS
  - I wanted to try and recreate the Apple calculator as closely as possible
- HTML
  - Using external icon set - [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
